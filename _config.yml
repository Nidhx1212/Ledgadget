<p> 
   Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. 
<br>
The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. 
<br>
Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. 
<br><br>
Hence, Technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.
